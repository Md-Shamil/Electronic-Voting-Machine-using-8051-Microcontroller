# Electronic-Voting-Machine-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project is an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) designed using the 8051 microcontroller to ensure a secure, reliable, and efficient voting process. The system allows users to cast votes through push buttons, display results in real-time on an LCD screen, and reset the system after each voting session.
